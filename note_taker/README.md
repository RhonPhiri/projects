# note_taker

This is a flutter project, a note taking app.

## Purpose

I created this app, to practice my skills gained in learning how to use the provider package and the path_provider package.

### Objective
Users should be able to:
- Create a note and save or cancel it
- Update an existing note or delete it
- Save and load from the local storage
- Search for a note using the title or content
- sort them using the date, alphabet
